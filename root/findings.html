    <h1>Ten Findings</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>&ltbdi&gt tag - not compatible with all browsers.</li>
        <li>The &ltnoscript&gt element is a blunt instrument. Sometimes, scripts might be enabled, but 
            for some reason the page's script might fail. For this reason, it's generally better 
            to avoid using noscript, and to instead design the script to change the page from 
            being a scriptless page to a scripted page on the fly.</li>
        <li>&ltnoscript&gt is not supported in the XHTML syntax.</li>
        <li>&ltiframe&gt - Setting both the allow-scripts and allow-same-origin keywords together when 
            the embedded page has the same origin as the page containing the iframe allows the 
            embedded page to simply remove the sandbox attribute and then reload itself, 
            effectively breaking out of the sandbox altogether.</li>
        <li>&lttrack&gt tags don't seem to work when testing locally. It only works when run on a server.</li>
        <li>onmousewheel event does not seem to exist. HTML would not recognize it and I could not find any proper documentation on it.</li>
        <li>&ltiframe&gt tag works fine locally, I can set the sandbox attribute and I am able to see the the embedded window inside the main window. The
            problem arises when the website is being hosted on the server. the &ltiframe&gt tag does not seem to work and display its content. I am assuming the 
            browsers have some kind of security to prevent the tag from running.</li>
