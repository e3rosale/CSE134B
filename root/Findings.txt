FINDINGS
=========

1. <bdi> tag - not compatible with all browsers.
2. The noscript element is a blunt instrument. Sometimes, scripts might be enabled, but 
   for some reason the page's script might fail. For this reason, it's generally better 
   to avoid using noscript, and to instead design the script to change the page from 
   being a scriptless page to a scripted page on the fly.
   Also, noscript is not supported in the XHTML syntax.
3. noscript tags are only displayed if the the script tag is not supported or dissabled.
4. iframe - Setting both the allow-scripts and allow-same-origin keywords together when 
   the embedded page has the same origin as the page containing the iframe allows the 
   embedded page to simply remove the sandbox attribute and then reload itself, 
   effectively breaking out of the sandbox altogether.
5. onmousewheel method does not exist. At least I could not find any documentation for it.
